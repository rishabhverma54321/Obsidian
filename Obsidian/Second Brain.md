Second brain is a methodology to storing information, ideas, insights in a digital or analogue format. It works like an extended but more filtered memory of yours.You can understand this concept by considering your brain as the RAM of the system (it only produce idea rather then stored them) and the ROM as a second brain to organize those information or those ideas.

 ### **Four component of second brain**
 
 CODE - >
 
 - C (capture) => Capture all the information, ideas, implementation wrote it in either on mobile or notepad. In my case i'm using obsidian as a second brain.
 - O (organize) => Organise your capture data in a well structured format so that its didn't jumbled up and got confused. The organized data is save more time then unorganized data. 
 - D (Distil) => Distilling information help u to read ur information more quickly. Every time after wrote a summary always add key points or highlight key words that's help you to save time when u read those again in future. Try to understand the topic first and wrote it in own language for better understanding for future.
 - E (Express) -> Don't just wrote the information in a notepad and just go away. Try to implement those as well. Share them on social media and learn while helping others
